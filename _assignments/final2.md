# Final Exam - Part 2

### Release: 8am PDT Tuesday June 7, 2022
### Due: 8am PDT Friday June 10, 2022

**We will not accept late submissions. There will be no exceptions.**

This page details a take-home exam that you will complete over the next few
days. You canâ€™t communicate with anyone about the content of the assignment
until the exam has concluded. **DO NOT** post clarification or other similar questions as staff will not be answering these types of questions during this time period. If there are broken links or otherwise strange parts of the writeup, you may post these concerns on piazza. 

Do not use any online service other than Piazza to ask questions about the
exam. Do not search for, solicit, or use solutions to the problems that
you find elsewhere for the exam. These are all violations of academic integrity
that students have committed on exams like this in the past.

You can make use of any course notes, online resources about Java and its
libraries, Java tools, and so on to complete the exam, including re-using code
from class notes or PAs.

You can review the grading policy for exams in the [syllabus](https://ucsd-cse12-sp22.github.io/syllabus.html).
